turn.js provides an example with zoom. The difficulty to make it work is to gather all the required files. But if you watch the code, it is possible. Say the root is magazine, it goes two folders up to get lib and extras folders where java scripts are laying. In addition, you have to add the "default" and large pages in the pages folder. When you get the sample, there are only the thumbnails in. Say for 1-thumb.jpg, you have to add 1.jpg and 1-large.jpg

There is a very usefull Firefox plugin to get them : CacheViewer.

I have managed to do it with my book, and reorganize the paths in the code to have something cleaner: put lib and extras at the same level than pages. A recursive grep for "/../../" will give you all the locations in html and js code.
